# Contributing to OpenRock

Thank you for considering contributing to **OpenRock**! This is an open-source reverse engineering and modernization project focused on *Will Rock* (2003). Contributions are welcome from anyone interested in reverse engineering, game preservation, or cross-platform development.

## How Can I Help?

You don't need to be an expert â€” just curious and willing to learn. Here are some ways to contribute:

- Analyze disassembled code using Ghidra or IDA Pro
- Identify and document functions and structures
- Extract assets like textures, models, and audio
- Help write or refactor engine code using modern cross-platform libraries
- Write tests, documentation, or tools for analysis

## Development Goals

- Reverse engineer the original binary to understand internal logic and data structures
- Reimplement the game engine in a modular way
- Replace Win32 and DirectX dependencies with cross-platform equivalents (e.g., SDL, Vulkan, OpenGL)
- Support building and running on multiple platforms: Windows, Linux, macOS

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature or fix.
2. Keep commits small and descriptive.
